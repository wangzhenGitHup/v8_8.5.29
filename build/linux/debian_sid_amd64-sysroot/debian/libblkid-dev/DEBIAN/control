Description: block device ID library - headers and static libraries
 The blkid library allows system programs such as fsck and mount to
 quickly and easily find block devices by filesystem UUID or label.
 This allows system administrators to avoid specifying filesystems by
 hard-coded device names and use a logical naming system instead.
 .
 This package contains the development environment for the blkid library.
