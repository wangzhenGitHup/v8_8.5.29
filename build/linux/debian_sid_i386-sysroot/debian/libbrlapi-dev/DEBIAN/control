Description: Library for communication with BRLTTY - static libs and headers
 BRLTTY is a daemon which provides access to the console (text mode)
 for a blind person using a braille display.  It drives the braille
 display and provides complete screen review functionality.

 BrlAPI is a library which gives an application access to a braille display and
 lets it write braille.

 This package contains the static library libbrlapi.a and header files
 in /usr/include/brltty/ necessary to compile programs for BrlAPI, a
 client-server based mechanism to remotely access a braille display.
